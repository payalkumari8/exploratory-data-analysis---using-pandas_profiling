# Outline of the Project
 
This project involves the uses of Pandas profiling library to generate  the EDA report of the heart attack downloaded from kaggle.
Pandas-Profiling library interpretes the Dataframe and calculates following automatically:
Type inference: detect the types of columns in a dataframe.
Essentials: type, unique values, missing values
Quantile statistics like minimum value, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, range, interquartile range
Descriptive statistics like mean, mode, standard deviation, sum, median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness

Most frequent values
Histogram
Correlations highlighting of highly correlated variables, Spearman, Pearson and Kendall matrices
Missing values matrix, count, heatmap and dendrogram of missing values
Text analysis learn about categories (Uppercase, Space), scripts (Latin, Cyrillic) and blocks (ASCII) of text data.
